A five-day workshop on the Harriot Papers at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana will be held from 12 to 15 September 2022. It is a hybrid event beginning with an introduction to ITF by Neil Jefferies, and continuing with talks by invited guests in the mornings, followed by collaborative transcription sessions with manuscript page images. Part of the object is to look for user experience stories, and to observe people producing the transcription.
