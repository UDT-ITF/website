The final reports for the 2023 UDT Workshops held in Oxford and Cambridge (with online participants) have been released. 
# Abstract
The Oxford workshop considered the question: ["How do we construct a useful text and text fragment reference mechanism that we can use as the basis for an API?"](/publications/2024-oxford-report). 

The Cambridge workshop built on this and asked ["To what extent can we map existing practices to annotations and text fragments?"](/publications/2023-02-24-cambridge).

The Notre Dame workshop series involved transcribing a particularly tricky set of texts, the papers of Thomas Harriot, and asked, ["How do we make Thomas Harriot digitally legible?"](/publications/2023-nd-report/)

Based on the outcomes on these workshops, a draft technical specification for an [Interoperable Text Framework](/api) is being developed.
