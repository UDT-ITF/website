Our [Position paper](/publications/2022-position-paper) has been released as a precursor to Oxford (26 Jan 2023) and Cambridge (24 Feb 2023) workshops.
# Abstract
Digital texts are all around us - from the objects and outputs of scholarly study, to the news, social media and other texts we interact with everyday online. But how long will these digital texts last? The problem with digital texts is that they come in a variety of formats that are hard to reuse because they require technical skills or infrastructure beyond most researchersâ€™ capabilities and funding. This project aims to scope and define an Interoperable Text Format (ITF) as a means for accessing and delivering text that is stored in a variety of extant formats as well as referencing text fragments. Importantly, we are aiming for something that is both human- and computer-readable.
