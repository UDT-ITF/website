The final reports for the 2023 UDT Workshops held in Oxford and Cambridge (with online participants) have been released. 
# Abstract
The Oxford workshop considered the question: ["How do we construct a useful text and text fragment reference mechanism that we can use as the basis for an API?"](/publications/2024-oxford-report)
The Cambridge workshop built on this and asked ["To what extent can we map existing practices to annotations and text fragments?"](/publications/2023-02-24-cambridge).

Based on the outcomes on these workshops, a draft technical specification for an [Interoperable Text Framework](/api) is being developed.
